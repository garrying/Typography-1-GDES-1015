# Exercise 3—Contrast and Concord

Basic ways of contrasting text in a composition can help convey meaning, express voice, communicate concept, or aid navigation. Canadian designer, Carl Dair, in his book Design with Type outlines 7 kinds of contrast that help readers comprehend text information through manipulating or arranging form and compositing elements in 2D space. These visual contrasts can be used individually but are often used in combination in order to create visual interest and/or communicate effectively. This exercise will allow you to explore these contrasts and observe the visual and semantic effects they produce.

## Learning Objectives
- Employ typographic classification to make informed decisions when selecting and combining typefaces.
- Manipulate basic typographic/spatial structures at the level of word and sentence.
- Integrate systematic processes and decision-making into both design activity and its documentation.

## Materials/Tools Required
- Laptop
- Adobe InDesign CC
- Text editor (e.g. TextEdit, Sublime Text, TextWrangler)
- Black and white Laser printing credits (optional)
- Pencil, or pen (optional)

## Steps
1. Create a 8” x 8” square document in Adobe InDesign
    - Make this a non-facing pages document
    - Remove the default margins
    - Create a 1pt black border for all pages (use a “base” layer, or add to the master page, for efficiency)
    - Add at least 20 pages to the document
2. Choose a pair from the source text documents provided in Canvas Files, under week-05 (e.g. DM - cover, DM - text)
3. Create a composition using only type (no images, no shapes) for each text document in the pair you chose
4. Employ one of the “seven contrasts”
    - size
    - weight
    - form
    - structure
    - texture
    - direction
    - colour (optional)
5. Take note of the following visual effects:
    - order, sequence of viewing
    - emphasis
    - voice
    - readability
    - legibility
    - visual interest
6. (optional) Print a black and white laserprint of this first version
7. Explore a different composition and improve on your first version by adjusting and using 2 or 3 different kinds of contrasts at once
8. Create at least 10 compositions for each text from the pair you chose (Initial version, improved version, total at least 20 compositions)
9. Explore the different texts, try not to get stuck on a single composition
10. Use different pages in your InDesign file
11. Submit the final InDesign file by end of class
