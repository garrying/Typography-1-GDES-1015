# Project 2—Instrumental Type: Communicating Different Levels of Information

Structuring information through the control of space, difference and sequence is part of what designers do everyday. This project will help you develop an understanding of what is needed to visually arrange information in order to communicate. You will also begin to develop skills in using software to create create documents efficiently. Designers also need to have a very good understanding of the content in order to design properly for it. For this reason, you are also asked to be take responsibility for writing the content so that you bridge the requirements of content with the requirements of form in the service of communication. Your final outcome will be a poster that displays a large amount of information that will be consulted many times over a relatively long period of time.

## What you will do in this project
- Research, Write and Edit
    - Explore a use case where complex information needs to be presented all at once (e.g. periodic table, event schedule, reference guide, directory) in an analog/physical and semi-permanent manner (i.e. poster)
    - Create content that is clearly structured and has a variety of information types
- Analyse and Structure
    - Understand how a user/reader will access the information
    - Choose what is important to read by deciding how to order and sequence information
    - Organize information into meaningful chunks using space and contrasts
- Iterate and Refine
    - Produce versions that progressively improve
    - Produce a final poster

## How you will do it
- Research and Write
    - This can come from a variety of sources (you don’t have to write all the text) and you can copy text directly but you need to be (or become) very familiar with the content
    - Multiple kinds of information (e.g. subtitle, caption, short body text, numbers, dates, links, authors)
    - A main title
    - Write/edit approximately 400-1000 words
    - Only text will be used for this project (no images)
    - **Evaluation:** Grades based on the amount and quality of research done, the writing/editing done and the care with which the documentation was created
- Analysis and Structure
    - Begin with the text you have written
    - Create pencil sketches to explore ways of structuring the information
    - Employ basic forms of contrast to differentiate between types of information
    - Choose two typefaces (from your Adobe Font Folio or Adobe TypeKit or from Google Fonts) that will help you distinguish information elements
    - Employ spatial arrangement to help viewers see the structure of the information
    - Sparse use of lines can be used to help structure information
    - **Evaluation:** Grades based on complexity/sophistication of analysis, number of approaches taken (i.e. sketches made)
- Iterate and Refine
    - Create a digital version in InDesign
    - Improve on the latest version, print small draft version (scaled to 11” x 17”)
    - Mark up the printed version with potential refinements, revisions; go to previous step; repeat until you have a version you find satisfactory
    - Print out a test at actual size (24” x 36”) at least once to see how it functions at full size
    - **Evaluation:** Grades based on the number of iterations made, number of approaches taken, progress made

## What you will hand in
- **Process Zine**
    - 8-page saddle-stitched (Letter size folded)
    - Show your progress through sequence of iteration
    - Use the template provided
- **Poster**
    - 24” x 36” black and white printed output on 20 lb bond white paper
    - NOTE: please use OCADu’s Copy and Print Services (approx. $6 total)

## Learning Objectives for this Project
- Analyze and explain the contributing factors of readability, legibility and hierarchy as the fundamentals of effective typographic communication.
- Employ typographic classification to make informed decisions when selecting and combining typefaces.
- Manipulate basic typographic/spatial structures at the level of word and sentence.
- Integrate systematic processes and decision-making into both design activity and its documentation.
