# Exercise 4â€”Texture and Value

Long passages of text, through the pattern created by letterforms, words and paragraphs, can create distinct visual effects such as value (i.e. lightness/darkness) and texture (i.e. coarse/fine). These visual effects can be used to create interest in compositions and aid in readability (i.e. ability to comfortably read text) and legibility (i.e. ability to discern one letterform or word from another). This exercise will allow you to explore these effects by selection of typeface and style, and adjusting different typographic settings.

## Learning Objectives
- Manipulate basic typographic/spatial structures at the level of word and sentence.
- Analyze and explain the contributing factors of readability, legibility and hierarchy as the fundamentals of effective typographic communication.

## Materials/Tools Required
- Laptop
- Adobe InDesign CC
- Adobe Font Folio
- BW Laser printing credits
- (optional) Marker pen or pencil

## Steps
1. Create a 10"x10" square document in Adobe InDesign
2. Add your name in 8pt near the edge of the document's Master page
3. Create a composition of multiple square and rectangular text blocks of varying sizes to accommodate one of the provided source texts
    - [The Mushroom at the End of the World](#)
    - [Preservation and Permanence](#)
    - [Muriel Cooper](#)
    - [In Defense of the Poor Image](#)
4. Vary the value (lightness/darkness) and texture (coarse/fine) by doing the following:
    - Use any combination of these fonts: Cabin, Grotesque MT, Janson Text, Cronos Pro
    - Use different styles within each font (e.g. roman, italic/oblique, bold)
    - Use different sizes
    - Use different leading
    - Use different tracking
    - Use different grids
    - Set all type as justified text
5. Take note of the effects of value and texture on composition, visual interest, sequence of reading, and readability/legibility
6. Print a black and white laserprint
7. Explore different compositions and improve on your last version by varying arrangement, type choices, size, grid structure, and number of text blocks
8. Create at least 15 different compositions as individual pages in your InDesign file (and feel free to use different texts along the way)
9. Submit the printed package of all versions by end of class
