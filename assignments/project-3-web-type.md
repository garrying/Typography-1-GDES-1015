# Project 3—Web Type: Typography for Reading on Screens

Using code to arrange and style typography is a common part of designing for screens. Encoding text also allows for flexibility, efficiency, programmability and responsiveness—this is especially useful in cases where information is dynamic or interactive. In this project you will apply your knowledge of the expressive and instrumental dimensions of type and typography. You will use type to express to the user a cultural meaning, emotional characteristic, and/or material dimension. You will also use type to aid the user in reading longer forms of text. You will design a single-serving site of a long-form article that can be viewed on a mobile device (e.g. phone or tablet).

## What you will do in this project
- Select and Read
    - Select a long-form article (See list of articles)
    - Read the article to understand the content and how to design for it
- Preparation and Setup
    - Set up HTML/CSS files
    - Add appropriate tags to control sections of the text
    - Create classes or unique tags for the text
- Iterate and Refine
    - Select typefaces that are appropriate for your design
    - Produce versions that progressively improve
    - Reflect on the reading experience
    - Add optional features
    - Produce a final site

## How you will do it
- Select and Read
    - Pick a long-form article from the list provided (or suggest your own)
    - Read the article
    - Make notes on its content (e.g. story, history, feeling, point of view, style of writing, genre, author’s body of work) and its intended audience (e.g. age, life experience, language, cultural history)
- Preparation and Setup
    - Use your browser (e.g. Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and text editor (e.g. Sublime Text, Atom, VSCode) to:
    - Inspect the initial file provided on Canvas (under Files/Project 3/articles)
    - Set up your HTML file to contain your
    - Set up your CSS file
- Iterate and Refine
    - Use your Chrome/Firefox/Safari browser’s developer tool
    - Use your own mobile device (hosted on glitch.com)
    - use CSS media queries for responsive site design
    - use images sparingly
    - use anchor links to help the reader navigate the site
    - create a bilingual site
    - use CSS Grid to format text
    - Choose two typefaces (from Google Fonts) that will help you distinguish information elements
    - Employ basic forms of contrast to differentiate between types of information
    - Use typography (typeface choices, formatting) to help reflect the content of the book
    - Test on your design
    - Review and revise/improve
    - Make a screen grab of each version you create

## What you will hand in
- Process Zine
    - 8-page saddle-stitched (Letter size folded)
    - Include your initial notes
    - Show your progress through sequence of iteration
- Site
    - Site folder titled with your name and book title (e.g. JohnSmith_Skinfolk)—compressed as ZIP archive
    - URL of your site
    - Submitted on Canvas

## Schedule

## Learning objectives
- Analyze and explain the contributing factors of readability, legibility and hierarchy as the fundamentals of effective typographic communication.
- Employ typographic classification to make informed decisions when selecting and combining typefaces.
- Manipulate basic typographic/spatial structures at the level of word and sentence.
- Integrate systematic processes and decision-making into both design activity and its documentation.
