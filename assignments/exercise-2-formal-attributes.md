# Exercise 2—Formal Attributes

Using our learned language and having a keen eye to notice formal qualities of type are necessary to using type to express subtle qualities to a viewer. Language helps us identify important aspects of the visual field and helps us communicate to other designers intention, direction, etc. This exercise will ask you to review formal attributes described by Catherine Dixon and use them to describe the connotations of typographic forms.

## Learning Objectives

- Identify and describe typographic form, proportion, measure and anatomy.
- Employ typographic classification to make informed decisions when selecting and combining typefaces.

## Materials/Tools Required
- Laptop
- Adobe Illustrator CC
- BW Laser printing credits (Printing 8.5×11)

## Steps
1. Pick 5 very different typefaces from the Adobe Font Folio folder provided to you in class earlier in the course
2. Install each font you’ve chosen onto your computer (select the font files within a chosen folder, double-click to open, select “Install”)
3. Download the PDF titled “Baines Haslam - Type and Typography Chapter 3 Form” from Canvas Files (under “week-03”)
4. Review the section “Formal Attributes” (pages 54, 55, 58)
5. Review the sections from “Sources and Patterns” (pages 59 to 86) which you think are useful for describing the typefaces you’ve chosen
6. Use the formal attributes listed, sources/patterns (where relevant), and anatomy terms covered last week to describe the glyphs from one of the typefaces you’ve selected
7. Write an outline (as many bullet points as you can) of formal details of the glyphs
8. Write an outline (as many bullet points as you can) of the associations and meanings you personally infer from the glyphs
9. Download the Exercise 2 – Formal Attributes template (in Canvas Files under "week-03")
10. Open the template in Adobe Illustrator
11. Set the letters “baegnxARQEN” on the template
12. Indicate the baseline, descender, ascender, x-height of the typeface (using lines and text)
13. Annotate (using lines/arrows and text) the various aspects of the forms (using the outlined notes you completed above)
14. Save this version
15. Repeat for each of the 5 typefaces you’ve chosen
16. Print a black and white laserprint for each (Single-sided, white, letter size) 
17. Submit a package of 5 sheets by end of class
