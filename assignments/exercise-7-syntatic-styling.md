# Exercise 7—Syntactic Styling

Designing the visual arrangement of web typography focuses more on the syntactic rather the semantic aspects of the web page. While building on the semantic encoding of the elements of a page, the visual styling possible with CSS will allow you to place type more precisely and control aspects that affect their readability and aesthetics (form, space, colour, etc.). In this exercise you are able to apply your growing knowledge of HTML and CSS to an existing file to make the text more visually interesting and readable.

## Learning Objectives
- Manipulate basic typographic/spatial structures at the level of word and sentence.
- Analyze and explain the contributing factors of readability, legibility and hierarchy as the fundamentals of effective typographic communication.
- Integrate systematic processes and decision-making into both design activity and its documentation.
