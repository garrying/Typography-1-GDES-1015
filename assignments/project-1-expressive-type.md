# Project 1—Expressive Type

Developing ways of looking, working and describing are essential skills for a visual designer. This project will help you identify and improve these skills by writing, documenting, and drawing (analog and digital). First, you will look attentively at your visual environment and pick out the typographic elements that are beautiful, expressive and meaningful to you. Second, you will visually study the anatomy and components of the artifacts you’ve chosen. Third, you will digitize the type you’ve been studying and create a composition. Fourth, you will write and reflect on the visual traits and meanings derived from the typefaces. These phases will be supported by supervised in-class exercises, short lecture/discussions and regular desk crits / progress updates.

## What you will do in this project
- Research and Document
    - Photograph and annotate typefaces you find interesting, meaningful, important, select a typeface you will focus on
    - Examine typeface of your choosing from the provided list below
- Analyse
    - Study the form of the glyphs
    - Redraw (by hand and digitally) the glyphs
- Refine and Present
    - Fine-tune your glyphs
    - Compose a layout that displays the glyphs
- Communicate
    - Write a “close reading” of your selected typeface and a typeface of your choosing from the provided list below

## How you will do it
- Research and Document
    - Use your camera (smartphone is fine) to take pictures of typefaces that you find beautiful, interesting, important. These can be on the street, store signs, printed material, anywhere — but you have to take the photo (no pre-photographed examples from Instagram for example).
    - You can document Latin-based and non-Latin-based glyphs; any language but be sure to focus on languages and writing systems that you are familiar with and that you have cultural connection to
    - Take multiple photos of the same typeface (e.g. close up, at an angle, from far away to show context, with you holding it or standing beside it to show scale).
    - Take note of the location, time, environment and anything that will help you think about the context of seeing/reading/experiencing that typography.
    - Take some notes immediately about why you took that photo and you think it is compelling. For example, write about how it makes you feel.
    - Take up to 10 photos of 5 different type examples.
    - Examine the type example of your choosing from the provided list below
    - **Evaluation:** Grades based on the amount of research done and the care with which the documentation was created
- Analyse
    - Select one of your typeface examples to be your focus for the rest of the assignment
    - Choose 3-4 glyphs from your own typeface selection
    - Choose 3-4 glyphs from a typeface of your choosing from the following list below (Click here to navigate)
    - Redraw by hand (using pencil on letter-sized white paper); make several attempts until you are satisfied with the execution
    - Redraw digitally (using Adobe Illustrator); make several versions (show your progress) until you are satisfied with the execution
    - **Evaluation:** Grades based on the number of iterations made, number of approaches taken, progress made
- Refine and Present
    - Revise details in the glyphs
    - Compare and smooth out discrepancies between the glyphs
    - Produce composition with the glyphs you have digitized (all 6 glyphs)
    - Use the provided template to arrange the glyphs (e.g. baseline, ascender, descender, x-height, anatomical details, insitu image) as a starting point
- Communicate
    - Write a visual analysis of both typefaces you’ve focussed on (i.e. your own and the one you have selected).
    - Use notes you’ve made from the beginning of the process.
    - Use the terminology explored in class and in handouts write a close reading of two typefaces.
    - Compare the two typefaces, describe and classify the typefaces
    - Use the tips covered in the Writing and Learning Centre’s in-class seminar to write your text
    - Write 250-500 words
    - **Evaluation:** Grades based on the quality of description, use of terms covered in class, complexity/sophistication of analysis, quality of writing

## What you will hand in
- **Research Zine**
    - 8-page saddle-stitched (8.5” x 11” Letter size, 2 sheets, black and white laserprint, folded, stapled along the spine)
