  <h1>The Shipbreakers</h1>
  <h2>William Langewiesche</h2>
  <p>At Alang, in India, on a six-mile stretch of oily, 
      smoky beach, 40,000 men tear apart half of the world's discarded 
      ships, each one a sump of toxic waste. Environmentalists in the West 
      are outraged. The shipbreakers, of course, want to be left alone -- 
      and maybe they should be.</p>
          <p>SHIP Captain Vivek A. 
      Pandey thought he could have been a fighter pilot. Because his father 
      had flown for the British before Indian independence, Pandey felt he 
      had flying in his blood. When he was a young man, he took the Indian 
      Pilot's Aptitude Test and astonished the examiners with his spatial 
      orientation, his instinct for flight instruments, and the sureness of 
      his reactions. They saw what he already knew -- that he was born with 
      the cool. So when he then went to sea, he was not running away but 
      making a choice. He explained it to me with a rhyme, "from aviation to 
      navigation," as if the two were nearly the same. For seventeen years 
      afterward Pandey ploughed the oceans in cargo ships and tankers, under 
      many flags. He became a captain and lived aboard his vessels in 
      master's quarters, some of which seemed to him as luxurious as hotel 
      suites. He visited Norfolk, Savannah, Long Beach, and all the big 
      ports of Europe. He liked the tidiness and power of a ship's command, 
      but eventually he got married and felt the pull of domesticity. And 
      so, nine years ago, after the birth of a daughter, he settled in the 
      state of Gujarat, on India's far-western shore.</p>
          <p>I found him there last 
      winter, in the black hours before dawn, on a beach called Alang -- a 
      shoreline strewn with industrial debris on the oily Gulf of Cambay, 
      part of the Arabian Sea. I'd been warned that Pandey would resent my 
      presence and see me as a meddlesome Westerner. But he gave no sign of 
      that now. He was a sturdy, middle-aged merchant captain wearing clean 
      khakis, sneakers, and a baseball cap. Outwardly he was a calm, 
      businesslike mariner with a job to do. He stood among a group of 
      diffident, rougher-looking men, some in traditional <i>lungis</i> and 
      turbans, and accepted offers to share their coconut meat and tea. He 
      checked his watch. He looked out across the dark sea.</p>
          <p>A high tide had raised 
      the ocean's level by thirty feet, bringing the waterline a quarter 
      mile inland and nearly to the top of the beach. In the blackness 
      offshore two ships lay at anchor, visible only by their masthead 
      lights. The first was a 515-foot general-cargo vessel named the 
      Pioneer 1, which hailed from St. Vincent, in the Caribbean. Pandey 
      raised a two-way radio to his lips and, calling himself "Alang 
      Control," said, "Okay, Pioneer One, heave up your anchor, heave up 
      your anchor."</p>
          <p>The Pioneer's captain 
      acknowledged the order in thickly accented English. "Roger. Heave up 
      anchor."</p>
          <p>To me Pandey said, "We'll 
      start off." He radioed the ship to turn away from the coast and gather 
      speed. "You make one-six-zero degrees, full ahead. What is your 
      distance from the ship behind you?"</p>
          <p>"Six cables, six cables."</p>
          <p>"Okay, you make course 
      one-six-zero, full ahead."</p>
          <p>The masthead lights began 
      to creep through the night. When the captain reported that the ship 
      was steady on the outbound course, Pandey ordered hard starboard 
      rudder. He said, "Let me know your course every ten degrees."</p>
          <p>The answer came back 
      shortly: "One-seven-zero, Pioneer One." The turn was under way.</p>
          <p>"One-eight-zero, Pioneer 
      One." I had to imagine, because I could not see, that great mass of 
      steel trembling under power and swinging toward the shore in the hands 
      of its crew. The captain called the changing courses with tension in 
      his voice. I got the impression he had not done this before. But 
      Pandey was nonchalant. He gazed at silhouettes of sheds that were at 
      the top of the beach. He sipped his tea. The radio said,</p>
          <p>"One-nine-zero ... 
      two-zero-zero ... two-one-zero."</p>
          <p>Pandey began talking 
      about the Pilot's Aptitude Test that he had taken years before. He 
      said, "It's a test for which you can appear only once in your 
      lifetime. Either you have the aptitude to be a pilot or you don't, so 
      it is a one-time course in a lifetime. And very interesting ..."</p>
          <p>"Two-two-zero."</p>
          <p>On that test, using 
      mechanical controls, Pandey had kept a dot within the confines of a 
      1.5-inch moving square. Now, using a hand-held radio, he was going to 
      ram the Pioneer, a ship with a beam of seventy-five feet, into a plot 
      on the beach merely ninety-eight feet wide. It was presumptuous of 
      him, and he knew it. I admired his cool. The lights of the ship grew 
      closer. The radio said, "Two-three-zero." Pandey said, "Okay, Captain, 
      you are ballasting, no?"</p>
          <p>"Yes, sir, we are 
      ballasting. Ballasting is going on."</p>
          <p>"Very good, please 
      continue."</p>
          <p>The numbers counted up. 
      At "three-one-zero," with the Pioneer now close offshore, Pandey 
      finally showed some emotion. Raising his voice, he said, "Okay, make 
      three-two-zero, steady her. Okay, now you give maximum revolution, 
      Captain! Give maximum revolution!"</p>
          <p>I went down to the 
      water's edge. The Pioneer came looming out of the darkness, thrashing 
      the ocean's surface with its single screw, raising a large white bow 
      wake as it rushed toward the beach. I could make out the figures of 
      men peering forward from the bridge and the bow. Now the sound of the 
      bow wave, like that of a waterfall, drowned the drumming of the 
      engine. A group of workers who had been standing nearby scattered to 
      safety. I stayed where I was. Pandey joined me. The Pioneer kept 
      coming. It was caught by an inshore current that carried it briefly to 
      the side. Then the keel hit the bottom, and the ship drove hard onto 
      the flooded beach, carried by its weight, slowing under full forward 
      power until the rudder no longer functioned and the hull veered out of 
      control and slid to a halt not a hundred yards from where we stood. 
      Anchors the size of cars rattled down the sides and splashed into the 
      shallows. The engine stopped, the lights switched off in succession 
      from bow to stern, and abruptly the Pioneer lay dark and still.</p>
          <p>I know that a ship is an 
      inanimate object, but I cannot deny that at that moment the Pioneer 
      did die. It had been built in Japan in 1971, and had wandered the 
      world under various owners and names -- Cosmos Altair, Zephyrus, 
      Bangkok Navee, Normar Pioneer. And now, as I stood watching from the 
      beach, it became a ferrous corpse -- in Indian law as well as in 
      practice no longer a ship but just a mass of imported steel. The 
      seamen who lingered aboard, probing the dead passageways with their 
      flashlight beams, were waiting for the tide to go out, so that they 
      could lower a rope ladder, climb down the side, and walk away on dry 
      ground. The new owner would have his workers start cutting the corpse 
      in the morning.</p>
          <p>I asked Pandey if he 
      found this sad, and he answered emphatically that he did not. He was a 
      powerful state official in a nation of powerful officials: he was the 
      port officer of Alang, a man who rode in a chauffeured car with a 
      state emblem on the hood, and it was important to him to appear 
      rational at all times. But the truth, I thought later, might even be 
      that he enjoyed these ship killings. He told me that during his tenure 
      he had personally directed every one -- altogether several thousand by 
      now -- and he took me along to his next victim, a small cargo vessel 
      also from the Caribbean, which he had already sent speeding toward its 
      destruction. He was proud of his efficiency. He mentioned a personal 
      record of seven ships in succession. He was Pandey the ace, a champion 
      executioner.</p>
          <p>Then dawn spread across 
      his gargantuan landscape -- Alang, in daylight barely recognizable as 
      a beach, a narrow, smoke-choked industrial zone six miles long, where 
      nearly 200 ships stood side by side in progressive stages of 
      dissection, yawning open to expose their cavernous holds, spilling 
      their black innards onto the tidal flats, and submitting to the hands 
      of 40,000 impoverished Indian workers. A narrow, roughly paved 
      frontage road ran along the top of the beach, parallel to the ocean. 
      It was still quiet at dawn, although a few battered trucks had arrived 
      early, and were positioning themselves now for the day's first loads 
      of steel scrap. On the ocean side the frontage road was lined by the 
      metal fences that defined the upper boundaries of the 183 shipbreaking 
      yards at Alang. The fences joined together into an irregular 
      scrap-metal wall that ran intermittently for most of the beach, and 
      above which the bows of ships rose in succession like giants emerging 
      from the sea. Night watchmen were swinging the yard gates open now, 
      revealing the individual plots, each demarcated by little flags or 
      other markers stuck into the sand, and heavily cluttered with cut 
      metal and nautical debris. The yards looked nearly the same, except 
      for their little offices, usually just inside the gates. The most 
      marginal yards could afford only flimsy shacks or open-sided shelters. 
      The more successful yards had invested in more solid structures, some 
      of concrete, with raised verandahs and overhead fans.</p>
          <p>The workers lived just 
      across the frontage road, in a narrow shantytown with no sanitation, 
      and for the most part with no power. The shantytown did not have a 
      name of its own. It stretched for several miles through the middle of 
      Alang, and had a small central business section, with a few small 
      grocery stalls and stand-up cafés. It was dusty, tough, and crowded. 
      Unemployment there was high. The residents were almost exclusively 
      men, migrants from the distant states of Orissa and Uttar Pradesh. 
      They toiled under shipyard supervisors, typically from their home 
      states or villages, who dispensed the jobs, generally in return for a 
      cut from the workers' already meager pay. The workers chose to work 
      nonetheless, because the alternatives were worse. In the morning light 
      now, they emerged from their shacks by the thousands and moved across 
      the frontage road like an army of the poor. They trudged through the 
      yards' open gates, donned hard hats, picked up crowbars and 
      sledgehammers, and lit crude cutting torches. By eight o'clock, the 
      official start of the workday, they had sparks showering from all the 
      ships nearby, and new black smoke rising into the distance along the 
      shore.</p>
          <p>ALANG is a wonder of the 
      world. It may be a necessity, too. When ships grow old and expensive 
      to run, after about twenty-five years of use, their owners do not pay 
      to dispose of them but, rather, the opposite -- they sell them on the 
      international scrap market, where a typical vessel like the Pioneer 
      may bring a million dollars for the weight of its steel. Selling old 
      ships for scrap is considered to be a basic financial requirement by 
      the shipping industry -- a business that has long suffered from small 
      profits and cutthroat competition. No one denies that what happens 
      afterward is a dangerous and polluting process.</p>
          <p>Shipbreaking was 
      performed with cranes and heavy equipment at salvage docks by the big 
      shipyards of the United States and Europe until the 1970s, when labor 
      costs and environmental regulations drove most of the business to the 
      docksides of Korea and Taiwan. Eventually, however, even these 
      entrepreneurial countries started losing interest in the business and 
      gradually decided they had better uses for their shipyards. This meant 
      that the world's shipbreaking business was again up for grabs. In the 
      1980s enterprising businessmen in India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan 
      seized the initiative with a simple, transforming idea: to break a 
      ship they did not need expensive docks and tools; they could just 
      wreck the thing -- drive the ship up onto a beach as they might a 
      fishing boat, and tear it apart by hand. The scrap metal to be had 
      from such an operation could be profitably sold, because of the 
      growing need in South Asia for low-grade steel, primarily in the form 
      of ribbed reinforcing rods (re-bars) to be used in the construction of 
      concrete walls. These rods, which are generally of a poor quality, 
      could be locally produced from the ships' hull plating by small-scale 
      "re-rolling mills," of which there were soon perhaps a hundred in the 
      vicinity of Alang alone. From start to finish the chain of 
      transactions depended on the extent of the poverty in South Asia. 
      There was a vast and fast-growing population of people living close to 
      starvation, who would work hard for a dollar or two a day, keep the 
      unions out, and accept injuries and deaths without complaint. Neither 
      they nor the government authorities would dream of making an issue of 
      labor or environmental conditions.</p>
          <p>The South Asian industry 
      took about a decade to mature. In 1983 Gujarat State proclaimed Alang 
      its shipbreaking site, when it was still a pristine shore known only 
      to a few fishermen, without even a dirt road leading to it. Twenty-two 
      shipbreakers leased plots and disposed of five small ships that year. 
      The following year they disposed of fifty-one. The boom began in the 
      early 1990s, as the richer countries of East Asia continued to 
      withdraw from the business.</p>
          <p>Today roughly 90 percent 
      of the world's annual crop of 700 condemned ships now end their lives 
      on the beaches of Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh -- and fully half of 
      them die at Alang. With few exceptions, the breakers are not high-born 
      or educated men. They are shrewd traders who have fought their way up, 
      and in some cases have grown rich, but have never lost the poor man's 
      feeling of vulnerability. They have good reason to feel insecure. Even 
      with the most modest of labor costs, shipbreaking is a marginal 
      business that uses borrowed money and generates slim profits. The risk 
      of failure for even the most experienced breakers is real. Some go 
      under every year. For their workers the risks are worse: falls, fires, 
      explosions, and exposure to a variety of poisons from fuel oil, 
      lubricants, paints, wiring, insulation, and cargo slop. Many workers 
      are killed every year. Nonetheless, by local standards the industry 
      has been a success. Even the lowliest laborers are proud of what they 
      do at Alang. There is no ship too big to be torn apart this way. More 
      important, the economic effects are substantial -- Alang and the 
      industries that have sprung from it provide a livelihood, however 
      meager, for perhaps as many as a million Indians. Imagine, therefore, 
      their confusion and anger that among an even greater number of rich 
      and powerful foreigners, primarily in Northern Europe, Alang has also 
      become a rallying cry for reform -- a name now synonymous with Western 
      complicity and Third World hell.</p>
          <p>CAPTAIN Pandey by 
      daylight was less in control than he had seemed at night. He appeared 
      tired, even fragile. We stood on the beach among the immense steel 
      carcasses. I brought up the subject of the international campaign, led 
      by Greenpeace in Amsterdam, to reform the process of ship scrapping 
      worldwide. Although global in theory, the campaign in practice is 
      directed mostly against the biggest operation -- the beach here at 
      Alang. I had been told that Pandey took the campaign as a personal 
      attack -- and indeed, at the mention of Greenpeace he struggled 
      visibly to maintain his composure. His face grew tight and angry. He 
      spoke emphatically, as if to keep from raising his voice. Very clearly 
      he said, "The purposeful propaganda against this yard should be 
      countered. You come and look at the facts, and I'm proud of what I 
      have done over here. So there is nothing to hide." He sounded 
      secretive anyway. He implied that a cabal of shadowy forces was 
      conspiring against Alang, and that the real purpose of the 
      environmentalists' campaign was to take the shipbreaking business away 
      from India. He said, "I can show them ten thousand other places 
      outside India, point them out, which are in even worse condition than 
      this. Why should they talk about my country alone?"</p>
          <p>Pandey had given his 
      squadron of uniformed guards strict orders to turn away any foreigners 
      trying to enter the yards through the main gate. But determined 
      foreigners kept slipping in anyway. They worked for environmental and 
      human-rights groups and took photographs of black smoke and red fire, 
      and of emaciated workers covered in oil -- strong images that, Pandey 
      felt, did not represent a balanced view of Alang. The moral 
      superiority implied by these missions was galling to many Indians, 
      especially here on the sacred ground of Gujarat, the birth state of 
      Mahatma Gandhi. Recently Greenpeace activists had painted slogans on 
      the side of a condemned ship. Pandey must have taken a special 
      pleasure in running that ship aground.</p>
          <p>He was a complex man. He 
      claimed to know that he couldn't have it both ways, that he couldn't 
      invite the world's ships to Alang and at the same time expect to keep 
      the world out. Yet he insisted on trying. After the sun rose, he took 
      me to his office, because he wanted to stop me from wandering through 
      the yards, and then he escorted me away from Alang entirely, because 
      he wanted to make sure I was gone. I did not mention that I had 
      already been at Alang for more than a week, or that I knew a side road 
      to the site and intended to return.</p>
          <h3>Shipbreaking, American Style</h3>
          <p>THE controversy over 
      Alang started on the other side of the world and a few years back, in 
      Baltimore, Maryland, along the ghostly industrial shoreline of the 
      city's outer harbor, where old highway signs warn motorists about 
      heavy smoke that no longer pours from the stacks. Early in 1996 a 
      Baltimore Sun reporter named Will Englund was out on the water when he 
      noticed a strange sight -- the giant aircraft carrier Coral Sea lying 
      partially dismantled beside a dock, "in a million pieces." Englund 
      looked into the situation and discovered that the Coral Sea was a 
      waterfront fiasco of bankruptcy, lawsuits, worker injuries, toxic 
      spills, and outright criminality. Of particular interest to Baltimore, 
      where thousands of shipyard workers had been disabled by asbestos, was 
      evidence of wholesale exposure once again to that dangerous dust. The 
      U.S. Navy, which still owned the hull, was guilty, it seemed, at least 
      of poor oversight. Englund's first report ran as a front-page story in 
      April of 1996. The Sun's chief editor, John Carroll, then decided to 
      go after the subject in full. He brought in his star investigative 
      reporter, Gary Cohn, a quick-witted man who had the sort of street 
      smarts that could complement Englund's more cerebral style.</p>
          <p>The two reporters worked 
      on the story for more than a year. Their investigation centered on the 
      United States, where shipbreaking had become a nearly impossible 
      business, for the simple reason that the cost of scrapping a ship 
      correctly was higher than the value of its steel. The only reason any 
      remnant of the domestic industry still existed was that since 1994 all 
      government-owned ships -- demilitarized Navy warships and also 
      decrepit merchant vessels culled from the nation's mothballed "reserve 
      fleet" by the U.S. Maritime Administration -- had been kept out of the 
      overseas scrap market as a result of an Environmental Protection 
      Agency ban against the export of polychlorinated biphenyls, the 
      hazardous compounds known as PCBs, which were used in ships' 
      electrical and hydraulic systems. In practice, the export ban did not 
      apply to the much larger number of U.S.-flagged commercial vessels, 
      which were (and are still) exported freely for overseas salvage. 
      Hoping somehow to make the economics work, American scrappers bought 
      the government ships (or the scrapping rights) at giveaway prices, 
      tore into them as expediently as possible, and in most cases went 
      broke anyway. As a result of these defaults, the Defense Department 
      was forced to repossess many of the vessels that it had awarded to 
      U.S. contractors. Conditions in the remaining yards were universally 
      abysmal. The problems existed nationwide -- in California, Texas, 
      North Carolina, and, of course, Maryland. Englund and Cohn were 
      surprised by the lack of previous reporting, and they were fascinated 
      by the intensity of the individual stories -- of death or injury in 
      hot, black holds, of environmental damage, and of repeated lawbreaking 
      and cover-ups. Cohn especially was used to working in the underbelly 
      of society, but not even he had imagined that abuses on such a scale 
      could still exist in the United States. Later I asked him if he had 
      been motivated by anger or moral outrage. He mulled over the question. 
      "I don't know that it was so much anger. I think we discovered a lot 
      of things that were wrong and needed correcting. But I wouldn't say 
      that we walked around angry all the time." Nonetheless the subject 
      became their obsession.</p>
          <p>At the same time that 
      Cohn and Englund were investigating the story, the Navy and the 
      Maritime Administration, faced with a growing backlog of rotting 
      hulls, were pressuring the EPA to lift its export ban. They wanted the 
      freedom to sell government ships for a profit on the South Asian scrap 
      market. Englund and Cohn realized that their investigation required a 
      visit to the place where many of these ships would end up if the ban 
      were lifted -- a faraway beach called Alang.</p>
          <p>The Sun hired an Indian 
      stringer to help with logistics, enlisted a photographer, and in 
      February of 1997 sent the team to India. Alang was still an innocent 
      place: the reporters were free to go where they pleased, to take 
      pictures openly, and to pay no mind to Captain Pandey. The reporters 
      were shocked by what they saw -- to them Alang was mostly a place of 
      death. And they were not entirely wrong. Soon after they left Alang, 
      sparks from a cutting torch ignited the residual gases in a tanker's 
      hold and caused an explosion that killed fifteen workers -- or fifty. 
      Alang was the kind of place where people hardly bothered to count.</p>
          <p>The Sun's shipbreaking 
      report hit the newsstands for three days in December of 1997. It 
      concentrated first on the Navy's failures inside the United States and 
      then on Alang. A little storm broke out in Washington. The Maryland 
      senator Barbara A. Mikulski promptly pronounced herself "appalled" and 
      requested a Senate investigation into the Navy's conduct. She called 
      simultaneously for the EPA's export ban to stay in place and for an 
      overhaul of the domestic program to address the labor and 
      environmental issues brought up by the Sun articles. Though Mikulski 
      spoke in stern moral terms, what she apparently also had in mind was 
      the creation of a new Baltimore jobs program -- involving the clean, 
      safe, and therefore expensive disposal of ships, to be funded in some 
      way by the federal government. The Navy had been embarrassed by the 
      Sun's report, and was in no position to counter Mikulski's attack. It 
      answered weakly that it welcomed discussions "to ensure [that] the 
      complex process of ship disposal is conducted in an environmentally 
      sound manner and in a way that protects the health and safety of 
      workers." Mikulski shot back a letter to Secretary of Defense William 
      Cohen: "Frankly, I was disappointed in their tepid comments. We don't 
      need hollow promises and clichés. We need an action plan and concrete 
      solutions."</p>
          <p>Her opinion was shared by 
      other elected officials with struggling seaports. The Maryland 
      representative Wayne T. Gilchrest announced that his maritime 
      subcommittee would hold hearings. The California representative George 
      Miller said, "I feel strongly that contributing to the pollution and 
      labor exploitation found at places like Alang, India, is not a fitting 
      end for these once-proud ships." Miller also argued that since the 
      Navy was paying the cleanup costs at its old bases, it should pay for 
      the scrapping of its old ships as well. It made sense. Certainly the 
      U.S. government could afford it.</p>
          <p>In the last days of 1997 
      the Navy surrendered, declaring that it was suspending plans to export 
      its ships. Reluctantly the Maritime Administration agreed to do the 
      same. The government had a backlog of 170 ships awaiting destruction 
      -- with others scheduled to join them. Faced with the continuing decay 
      of those ships -- and the possibility that some of them would soon 
      sink -- the Defense Department formed an interagency shipbreaking 
      panel and gave it two months to report back with recommendations. The 
      panel suffered from squabbling, but it dutifully went through the 
      motions of deliberation.</p>
          <p>During a public hearing 
      in March of 1998 the speakers made just the sort of dull and 
      self-serving statements that one would expect. Ross Vincent, of the 
      Sierra Club, said, "Waste should be dealt with where it is generated."</p>
          <p>George Miller said, "A 
      global environmental leader like the United States should not have as 
      a national policy the exporting of its toxic waste to developing 
      countries ill equipped to handle it."</p>
          <p>Barbara Mikulski said, 
      "We ought to take a look at how we can turn this into an opportunity 
      for jobs in our shipyards."</p>
          <p>Stephen Sullivan, of 
      Baltimore Marine Industries, said, "We have a singular combination of 
      shipbuilding, ship-conversion, and ship-repair expertise."</p>
          <p>And Murphy Thornton, of 
      the shipbuilders' union, said, "Those ships should be buried with 
      honor."</p>
          <p>In April of 1998 Englund 
      and Cohn won the Pulitzer Prize for investigative reporting. That same 
      month the shipbreaking panel issued its final report -- a bland 
      document that reflexively called for better supervision of the 
      domestic industry and wistfully maintained the hope of resuming 
      exports, but also suggested that a Navy "pilot project" explore the 
      costs of clean ship disposal in the United States. By September of 
      last year an appropriation had moved through Congress, and the future 
      finally seemed clear: the pilot project included only four out of 180 
      ships, but it involved an initial sum of $13.3 million, to be awarded 
      on a "cost plus" basis to yards in Baltimore, Brownsville, 
      Philadelphia, and San Francisco -- and by definition it was just the 
      start.</p>
          <p>This was Washington in 
      action. A problem had been identified and addressed through a 
      demonstrably open and democratic process, and a solution had been 
      found that was affordable and probably about right. Nonetheless, there 
      was also something wrong about the process -- an elusive quality not 
      exactly of corruption but of a repetitive and transparent dishonesty 
      that seemed to imply either that the public was naive or that it could 
      not be trusted with straight talk. Even the Baltimore Sun had joined 
      in: in September of 1998, when Vice President Al Gore went through the 
      motions of imposing another (redundant) ban on exports, an approving 
      Sun editorial claimed that the prohibition "especially benefits the 
      poorly paid and untrained workers in the wretched shipyards of South 
      Asia." Patently absurd assertions like that may help to explain why 
      shipbreaking reform, despite all the trappings of a public debate, 
      including coverage in the national press and even ultimately the 
      Pulitzer Prize, actually attracted very little attention in the United 
      States. The people who might naturally have spared this issue a few 
      moments of thought may have had little patience for the rhetoric. Or 
      maybe the subject just seemed too small and far away. For whatever 
      reason, the fact is that the American public did not notice the 
      linguistic nicety distinguishing the government ships in question from 
      the much larger number of commercial U.S.-flagged ships, which would 
      remain untouched by the reforms. So an argument about double 
      standards, which should at least have been heard, was expediently 
      ignored. Seen from outside the United States, the pattern was hard to 
      figure out. India, of course, paid attention to the controversy. At 
      Alang, where plenty of American commercial vessels still came to die, 
      people couldn't understand why the government's ships were banned. I 
      could never quite bridge the cultural gap to explain the logic. How 
      does one say that the process had simply become an exercise in 
      democracy from above? A subject had been tied off and contained.</p>
          <h3>Pollution's Poster 
          Child</h3>
          <p>TIED off and contained in 
      America, that is. As it turned out, the Sun's exposé did affect Alang, 
      but in a way that no one in Washington had anticipated. The surprise 
      came close on the heels of the Pulitzer Prize, when the hellish image 
      of Alang landed hard in Scandinavia and the countries of the Rhine, 
      where it ignited a popular movement for shipbreaking reform. If it 
      seems unlikely that ordinary people would genuinely care about a 
      problem so abstract and far away, nevertheless in Northern Europe 
      millions of them did. In The Hague a typically progressive Dutch 
      official explained to me that his countrymen had less-frantic lives 
      than Americans, and could spare the time for altruism.</p>
          <p>The campaign, which 
      continues today, was led from Greenpeace's global headquarters, in 
      Amsterdam, by plainspoken activists who started in where American 
      reformers hadn't ventured -- going after the big commercial shipping 
      lines. By this past spring the activists had muscled their way in to 
      the maritime lawmaking forums and had begun to threaten the very 
      existence of Alang.</p>
          <p>Their task was made 
      easier from the outset by the work of the emotive Brazilian 
      photojournalist Sebastião Salgado, who came upon the story when it was 
      young, in 1989, and captured unforgettable images of gaunt laborers 
      and broken ships on the beach in Bangladesh. In 1993 Salgado exhibited 
      his photographs at several shows in Europe and in his superb picture 
      book Workers, which was widely seen. An awareness of shipbreaking's 
      particular hardships began to percolate in the European consciousness, 
      as did the suspicion that perhaps somehow a caring West should 
      intervene. Then, in 1995, Greenpeace had a famous brush with marine 
      "salvage" when it discovered that Shell intended to dispose of a 
      contaminated oil-storage platform, the giant Brent Spar, by sinking it 
      in the North Atlantic. Greenpeace boarded the platform, led a consumer 
      boycott against Shell (primarily at gas stations in Germany), and with 
      much fanfare forced the humiliated company to back down. The Brent 
      Spar was towed to a Norwegian fjord and scrapped correctly, an 
      expensive job that continued until last summer. Greenpeace had once 
      again shown itself to be a powerful player on the European scene.</p>
          <p>It was powerful because 
      it was popular, and popular because it was audacious, imaginative, and 
      incorruptible. It also had a knack for entertaining its friends. When 
      the drama of Alang came into clear view, Greenpeace recognized the 
      elements for a new campaign. The organization was not being cynical. 
      For many years it had been involved in a fight to stop the export of 
      toxic wastes from rich countries to poor -- a struggle that had 
      culminated in an international accord known as the Basel Ban, an 
      export prohibition, now in effect, to which the European Union nations 
      had agreed. Greenpeace considered the Basel Ban to be an important 
      victory, and it saw the shipbreaking trade as an obvious violation: if 
      the ships were not themselves toxins, they were permeated with toxic 
      materials, and were being sent to South Asia as a form of waste. 
      Greenpeace was convinced that ships owned by companies based in the 
      nations that had signed the accord, no matter what flag those ships 
      flew, were clearly banned from export. It was a good argument. 
      Moreover, the shipping industry's counterargument -- that the ships 
      went south as ships, becoming waste only after hitting the beaches -- 
      provided a nice piece of double talk that Greenpeace could hold up for 
      public ridicule. And Alang, with its filth and smoke, provided perfect 
      panoramas to bring the point home. So Greenpeace went to war.</p>
          <p>It was October of 1998, a 
      year and a half after the Sun's visit. Captain Pandey was on guard 
      against trouble, but he must have been looking in the wrong direction. 
      A group of Greenpeace activists got onto the beach by posing as 
      shipping buffs interested in the story of a certain German vessel. 
      They said they wanted the ship's wheel. But they also wandered off and 
      took pictures of the squalor, and they scraped up samples from the 
      soil, the rubble, and the shantytown shacks. After analyzing those 
      samples, two German laboratories quantified what Greenpeace already 
      knew -- that Alang was powerfully poisonous, particularly for the 
      laborers who worked, ate, and slept at dirt level there. Greenpeace 
      issued the findings in a comprehensive report, the best yet written on 
      Alang. The report discussed the medical consequences of the 
      contaminants, and described the risk of industrial accidents, which 
      were rumored to cause 365 deaths a year. "Every day one ship, every 
      day one dead," went the saying about Alang, and although the report's 
      authors admitted that there was no way to verify this, it was a 
      formulation that people remembered.</p>
          <p>Greenpeace needed a 
      culprit to serve as a symbol of the European shipping business, and it 
      found one in the tradition-bound P&amp;O Nedlloyd, an Anglo-Dutch cargo 
      line that was openly selling its old ships on the Asian scrap market. 
      In the shadowy world of shipping, where elusive companies establish 
      offshore headquarters and run their vessels under flags of 
      convenience, P&amp;O Nedlloyd was a haplessly anchored target: it had a 
      big office building on a street in Rotterdam, and a staff of modern, 
      middle-class Europeans, altruists who tended to sympathize with 
      Greenpeace and would quietly keep it apprised of P&amp;O Nedlloyd's 
      intentions and movements. Also, because a related company called P&amp;O 
      Cruises operated a fleet of English Channel ferries and cruise ships, 
      P&amp;O Nedlloyd was likely to be sensitive to public opinion. In November 
      of 1998 Greenpeace staged a protest at the company's offices, erecting 
      a giant photograph of a scrapped ship at Alang along with a statement 
      in Dutch: "P&amp;O Nedlloyd burdens Asia with it." The press arrived, and 
      eventually a company director emerged from the building to talk to the 
      activists. He did not appear to be afraid or angry. He said it wasn't 
      fair to single out P&amp;O Nedlloyd, and he made the argument that 
      coordinated international regulation was needed. International 
      regulation was exactly what Greenpeace wanted -- but when the next 
      day's paper came out with a photograph captioned "P&amp;O and Greenpeace 
      agree," Greenpeace denied that there had been any understanding.</p>
          <p>The truth was that 
      Greenpeace needed resistance from P&amp;O Nedlloyd, and it would have had 
      to rethink its strategy if the company had submitted to its demands 
      and obediently stopped scrapping in Asia. But of course P&amp;O Nedlloyd 
      did not submit -- and, for that matter, could not afford to submit. 
      After its brief attempt at openness, it went into just the sort of 
      sullen retreat that Greenpeace might have hoped for. Greenpeace staged 
      a series of shipside banner unfurlings, and it dogged a doomed P&amp;O 
      Nedlloyd container vessel, appropriately called the Encounter Bay, as 
      it went about the world on its final errands. Millions of Greenpeace 
      sympathizers watched with glee. P&amp;O Nedlloyd was so unnerved by the 
      campaign that in the spring of last year it apparently painted a new 
      name on a ship bound for the Indian beach, in order, perhaps, to 
      disguise who owned it. Greenpeace found out and shouted in 
      indignation. When P&amp;O Nedlloyd then refused to comment, it began to 
      look like an old man turned to evil. This made for good theater -- 
      especially against the backdrop of the ubiquitous pictures of Alang. 
      With public opinion now fully aroused, the Northern European 
      governments began to move, introducing the first dedicated 
      shipbreaking initiatives into the schedules of the European Union and 
      the International Maritime Organization -- the London-based body for 
      the law of the seas. In June of last year the Netherlands sponsored an 
      international shipbreaking conference in Amsterdam -- a meeting whose 
      tone was established at the outset by an emotional condemnation of the 
      industry by the Dutch Minister of Transport. It was obvious to 
      everyone there that the movement for reform was gathering strength. It 
      was hard to know what changes would result -- and which shipbreaking 
      nations would be affected. But the reformers were ambitious, and their 
      zeal was genuine. I thought Pandey had reason to be afraid.</p>
          <p>IN London last fall I met 
      an affable Englishman named Brian Parkinson, who worked as a trade and 
      operations adviser for the International Chamber of Shipping, an 
      umbrella group of national shipowner associations. Parkinson had a 
      natural appreciation for the anarchy of the sea and an equally natural 
      aversion to the Greenpeace campaign. He said, "Shipping gets blamed 
      for everything. Global warming. Why the British don't have a decent 
      football team." For lunch we went to a dark little pub that should 
      have been on the docks. Parkinson told me that he was near the end of 
      his career and was looking forward to retirement. Meanwhile, however, 
      he was struggling gamely to keep pace with the times. He said, "A ship 
      registered in Panama, owned by a Norwegian, operating in the U.S., and 
      sold in India is not an export -- but we're not making that argument." 
      He said, "Maybe there are things that shipowners can do." First, he 
      had in mind a nice bit of public relations: "We're looking at creating 
      an inventory of hazardous components, a good-housekeeping guide. We 
      want to know how we can present the ship to the recyclers in the best 
      possible way." I complimented him on the word "recyclers," and he said 
      yes, right, it was rather good, wasn't it? But he was toying with 
      something a bit more real as well -- a proposal for voluntary 
      self-regulation, under which the industry would inspect and certify 
      the yards at the Asian beaches and then factor in good behavior when 
      choosing which ones to use. He mentioned that Shell had already sent 
      an inspector to a yard at Alang, and that he was said to have written 
      an in-house report. As evidence of progress, this seemed pretty slim. 
      I asked Parkinson what was to keep his scheme from becoming a 
      two-tiered arrangement, whereby a few image-conscious companies would 
      accept the expense of working with certified yards while all the other 
      shipowners continued with business as usual, selling their vessels to 
      the highest bidders. He said he worried about that too.</p>
          <p>At the central train 
      station in Amsterdam a few days later I met Parkinson's opponent, a 
      leader of the Greenpeace campaign, Claire Tielens, a young Dutch woman 
      with a walker's stride and an absolutist's frank gaze. We went to the 
      station café and talked.</p>
          <p>I asked her if she had 
      visited India yet, and she said no, but that for several years she had 
      been a reporter for an environmental news service in the Philippines, 
      so she knew about Third World conditions. I said, "Why did you choose 
      Alang? Why does it seem worse to you than the other industrial sites 
      in India?"</p>
          <p>She answered, "Because 
      here there is a very direct link with Western companies."</p>
          <p>"But if it's Western 
      companies at Alang, versus Indian companies somewhere else, what 
      difference does it make to the world's environment?"</p>
          <p>"Because those Western 
      companies pretend to us here with glossy leaflets that they are so 
      environmentally responsible. And it is a shame when they export their 
      shit to the developing world."</p>
          <p>"But from your 
      environmental point of view," I asked, "what difference does it make 
      who the polluter is, and whether he's a hypocrite or not? I mean, what 
      is it about shipbreaking? And what is it about Alang?"</p>
          <p>I kept phrasing my 
      questions badly. She kept trying to answer me directly, and failing, 
      and going over the same ground. Without intending to, I was being 
      unfair. She should have said, "We needed to make some choices, and so 
      we chose Alang. It was easy -- and look how far we've come." I think 
      that would have been about right. Instead she said, "Even by Indian 
      standards, Alang is bad." But India has a billion people, and it is 
      famously difficult to define.</p>
      <h3>Dark Satanic Mills</h3>
          <p>NEW Delhi sprawls on 
      dirty ground under ashen skies. It is an immense capital city, a noisy 
      expression of the Indian democracy, not quite the anarchy that at 
      first it appears to be but a conglomeration of countless private 
      worlds. I found myself there last winter at late-night dinners and 
      garden parties among the city's large middle class -- professionals 
      who drove when they might have walked, and inhabited houses like 
      little forts with guarded gates and shard-topped walls. They worried 
      about crime -- partly, I think, because they could defend against it. 
      The larger assaults on a life in New Delhi were simply overwhelming. A 
      friend of mine with a small trucking company was concerned about the 
      progressive failure of the city's infrastructure and what that meant 
      for his business. He took me to visit New Delhi's chief urban planner, 
      a powerful official who sat defeated at an empty steel desk in a big 
      bare office, and out of boredom and loneliness detained us with small 
      talk and offers of tea. After we escaped, my friend said, "It's 
      incredible, no? I wanted you to see this. It's like he's sitting there 
      at the end of the world."</p>
          <p>But to me it was the 
      pollution in New Delhi that seemed apocalyptic. The streams were dead 
      channels trickling with sewage and bright chemicals, and the air on 
      the streets was at times barely breathable. In the heat of the 
      afternoons a yellow-white mixture hung above the city, raining acidic 
      soot into the dust and exhaust fumes. At night the mixture condensed 
      into a dry, choking fog that enveloped the headlights of passing cars, 
      and crept with its stink into even the tightest houses. The residents 
      could do little to keep the poison out of their lungs or the lungs of 
      their children, and if they were poor, they could not even try. People 
      told me it was taking years off their lives. Yet New Delhi was 
      bursting its seams, because newcomers from rural India kept flooding 
      in.</p>
          <p>The big port city of 
      Bombay has a reputation for being just as dirty, but on the day I got 
      there, an ocean breeze was blowing, and in relative terms the air was 
      clean. When I mentioned this to Pravin S. Nagarsheth, the shipbreaker 
      I had come to see, he grew excited and said, "Yeah! Yeah!" because 
      relativity was precisely the point he wanted to make to me. Nagarsheth 
      was a nervous little man with a round and splotchy face and some 
      missing teeth. He had been scrapping ships for nearly thirty-five 
      years, first with a small yard here in Bombay, and then in a bigger 
      way at Alang. He was also the president of the Indian shipbreakers' 
      association, and as such he had taken the lead in the industry's 
      defense. He had traveled to the Amsterdam shipbreaking conference to 
      counter the reports of abuses at Alang. In his speech there he said, 
      "All these write-ups, I would say, are biased, full of 
      exaggerations.... One, however, wonders whether such reports are 
      deliberately written for public consumption in affluent Western 
      societies only.... The environmentalists and Greenpeace talk of future 
      generations, but are least bothered about the plight of the present 
      generation. Have they contributed anything constructive to mitigate 
      the plight of the people living below the poverty line in developing 
      countries? ... Living conditions of labor in Alang should not be 
      looked at in isolation. It is the crisis of urbanization due to job 
      scarcity. Large-scale slums have mushroomed in all cities.... The fact 
      remains that workers at Alang are better paid and are probably safer 
      than their counterparts back in the poor provinces of Orissa, Bihar, 
      and Uttar Pradesh. To provide housing and better living conditions ... 
      is financially impractical for a developing country like India, where 
      forty-five percent of the population is living below the poverty 
      line."</p>
          <p>We met in the lobby of a 
      shabby hotel in central Bombay. Nagarsheth kept leaning into me, 
      grabbing my arm to punctuate his arguments. He said, "Everybody knows 
      this is bad! It is not a point of dispute! What Greenpeace is saying 
      is even excellent! But their ideology does not provide solutions! This 
      generation cannot afford it!"</p>
          <p>Nagarsheth seemed to 
      worry that I would understand the country in some antiseptic way -- 
      for its computer industry, its novelists, or maybe even its military 
      might. But the India he wanted me to see was a place that related 
      directly to Alang -- an India drowning in the poverty of its people. 
      And so, rather than talking any more about shipbreaking, he insisted 
      on showing me around Bombay. He guided me into the city's slums, which 
      are said to be the largest in the world. Then he led me back toward 
      the city center, for miles through a roadside hell where peasants 
      lived wall-to-wall in scrap boxes and shacks, and naked children sat 
      listless in the traffic's blue smoke as if waiting to die. Nagarsheth 
      said, "Do you see this? Do you see this? You need to remember it when 
      you get to Alang."</p>
          <p>He was making a valid 
      point about relative levels of misery. I saw another level a few days 
      later in Bhavnagar, the nearest city to Alang, at a re-rolling mill, 
      where hull plates from the ships were being torch cut, heated, and 
      stretched into reinforcing bars. Bhavnagar is an uncrowded city by 
      Indian standards, with a population of perhaps 600,000 in a physical 
      shell that to a Westerner might seem better suited for perhaps a 
      fourth of that. The re-rolling mill I visited was one of many there. 
      It stood on the north edge of town, on a quiet dirt street wandered by 
      cows, at the end of a crumbling brick wall, beyond the dust and din of 
      the city's auto-rickshaws. The mill had a sagging iron gate. A 
      traveler would normally pass it by, perhaps seeing it as a poor but 
      peaceful scene. But I went inside, past an old brick building where 
      clerks sat idle behind bulky typewriters on an outside porch, and on 
      into the dark heart of the mill -- a large, open-sided shed where 
      perhaps a hundred emaciated men moved through soot and heavy smoke, 
      feeding scrap to a roaring furnace leaking flames from cracks in the 
      side. The noise in there was deafening. The heat was so intense that 
      in places I thought it might sear my lungs. The workers' clothes were 
      black with carbon, as were their hair and their skin. Their faces were 
      so sooty that their eyes seemed illuminated.</p>
          <p>The furnace was long and 
      low. The men working closest to the fire tried to protect themselves 
      by wrapping heavy rags around their mouths and legs. They cut the 
      steel plates into heavy strips, which they heaved into the inferno and 
      dragged through the furnace before wrestling them free, red-hot, at 
      the far end. Using long tongs, they slung the smoking metal, still 
      brightly glowing, through a graduated series of rollers, which 
      squeezed and lengthened it incrementally into the final product -- the 
      reinforcing rods, which were piled together and allowed to cool. It 
      was a punishing and dangerous procedure, requiring agility, strength, 
      and speed, and also the calculation of risk. The workers were quite 
      obviously exhausted by it. Some, I think, were slowly starving, 
      trapped in that cycle of nutritional deficit all too common in South 
      Asia, by which a man may gradually expend more calories on his job 
      than his wages will allow him to replace.</p>
      <h3>On the Beach</h3>
          <p>I TRAVELED from Bhavnagar 
      to Alang, thirty miles to the south, on a narrow road crowded with 
      jitneys and trucks, choked with blue exhaust, and battered by the 
      weight of steel scrap. The road ran like an industrial artery across 
      plains of denuded farmland, on which impoverished villages endured in 
      torpor and peasants scratched at the parched earth. Along the way 
      stood a few open-air cafés, where truck drivers could stop for soft 
      drinks and food, and a few small factories, where oxygen was 
      concentrated into steel bottles to be mixed later with cooking gas for 
      use in the cutting operations farther south. But otherwise the 
      roadside scenery remained agricultural until several miles before 
      Alang. There, next to a small house on the right, a collection of 
      lifeboats listed in the dirt. The lifeboats marked the start of 
      Alang's roadside marketplace, where specialized traders neatly sorted 
      and resold secondary merchandise from the ships. There were yards for 
      generators, motors, transformers, kitchen appliances, beds and other 
      furniture, wires and pipes, cables, ropes, life rings, clothing, 
      industrial fluids, and miscellaneous machinery. The traders lived 
      among their goods. The buyers came from all over India.</p>
          <p>The marketplace continued 
      for several miles to Alang's main gate. But the best way to the beach 
      for a Westerner, given Captain Pandey's concerns about foreigners, was 
      a small side road that branched off a few miles before the main gate 
      and wandered again through rural scenery. I passed a boy herding cows, 
      three women carrying water, a turbaned farmer hoeing. The heat was 
      oppressive. The air smelled of dung and dust. For a while it was 
      almost possible to forget that the ocean was near. But then the road 
      made a turn, and at the far end of a field an immense cargo ship rose 
      above the trees. Behind it, fainter and in the haze, stood another. 
      The ships seemed to emerge from the earth, as if the peasants had 
      found a way to farm them.</p>
          <p>My base at the beach was 
      Plot 138. It was a busy patch of ground, bounded at the top by one of 
      the standard sheet-metal fences. I threaded through piles of sorted 
      scrap, past the smoke of cutting crews, past chanting gangs carrying 
      heavy steel plate, past cables and chains and roaring diesel winches, 
      to the water's edge, where the hulk of a 466-foot Japanese-built cargo 
      ship called the Sun Ray, once registered in the Maldives, was being 
      torn apart by an army of the poor. Four hundred men worked there, 
      divided into three distinct groups -- a shipboard elite of cutters and 
      their assistants, who were slicing the hull into multi-ton pieces; a 
      ground crew of less experienced men, who winched those pieces partway 
      up the beach and reduced them there to ten-foot sections of steel 
      plate; and, finally, the masses of unskilled porters condemned to the 
      end of the production line, where, piece by piece, they would 
      eventually shoulder the entire weight of the hull, lugging the heavy 
      plates to the upper beach and loading them into trucks -- belching 
      monsters painted like Hindu shrines -- which would haul the scrap 
      away. And that was just for the steel. Everywhere I looked stood the 
      piles of secondary products awaiting disposal -- the barrels of oil 
      and hydraulic fluid and all the assorted equipment destined for the 
      roadside marketplace. In either direction I could look down the coast 
      at a line of torn ships fading into the smoke of burning oil.</p>
          <p>Alang at first is a scene 
      of complete visual confusion; it begins to make sense only after about 
      a week, when the visual impact fades, and the process of breaking a 
      ship by hand sorts itself out into a series of simple, brutal 
      activities. The first job is to shackle the ship more firmly to the 
      ground. Using motorized winches and a combination of anchor chains and 
      braided steel cables looped through holes cut into the bow, the 
      workers draw the hull as high onto the beach as the ship's draft and 
      trim allow, so that ideally the bow stands on dry ground even at high 
      tide. The winches are diesel-powered machines each the size of a small 
      bulldozer, staked firmly to the ground about halfway up the beach. The 
      stress on the cables during the winching operation is enormous. They 
      groan and clank under the load, and sometimes they snap dangerously. 
      The workers are ordered to stand clear. Nonetheless, some winch 
      operators sit unprotected by safety cages, and gamble that a broken 
      cable will never recoil directly back at them. It's easy to imagine 
      that sometimes they lose.</p>
          <p>After the initial 
      dragging is done, the crews climb aboard with ladders and ropes and 
      begin to empty the ship's fuel tanks: they pump the good oil into 
      barrels for resale, and slop the residual sludge of no commercial 
      value onto dry ground, where it is burned. The empty tanks continue to 
      produce volatile vapors, and pose a risk of explosion until they are 
      aerated -- a tricky process that often involves cutting ventilation 
      holes. The most experienced cutters are used for this work, because 
      they are believed to have developed noses for dangerous vapors. Even 
      so, there are explosions and fatalities -- though fewer now than 
      before, because of slowly improving safety standards. On some ships 
      the tanks can be sliced off whole, dropped into the water, and winched 
      above the tide line for dissection and disposal. Cutting on hard 
      ground is easier than cutting on the ship, and because the workers are 
      therefore more likely to do the job right, it is also safer. But 
      either way, the yard must demonstrate to Gujarat officials that the 
      fuel tanks have been secured and neutralized before they will give the 
      final authorization to proceed with the scrapping.</p>
          <p>With the risk of 
      explosion diminished, the breakers turn their attention to the ship's 
      superstructure, the thin-walled quarters that typically rise five or 
      six levels above the main deck, and in which, because of combustible 
      wiring and wood paneling, the chance of a deadly fire cannot be 
      ignored. The superstructure is like a ghost town, still full of the 
      traces of its former inhabitants. Scattered about lie old books and 
      magazines in various languages, nautical charts from faraway oceans, 
      company manuals, years' worth of ship's logs, newspaper clippings, 
      national flags, signal flags, radio frequency lists, union pamphlets, 
      letters, clothes, posters, and sometimes a much-appreciated stock of 
      liquor, narcotics, or pornography. The scrappers spread through the 
      quarters like hungry scavengers, quickly removing the furniture and 
      galley equipment, tearing into the wood paneling and asbestos 
      insulation to get at the valuable plumbing, stripping out the wires, 
      electronics, and instruments, and making a special effort to save the 
      ship's bell, always in demand for use at Hindu temples. These 
      treasures are roped down the side and hustled to the top of the beach 
      by ground crews.</p>
          <p>Then the cutting begins. 
      It is surprising how few men are needed to handle the torches: by 
      working simultaneously on the port and starboard sides, a dozen 
      competent cutters, backed up by a larger number of assistants, can 
      demolish an entire superstructure within two weeks. Gravity helps. 
      Starting with the overhanging wings of the bridge, the cutters slice 
      the superstructure into big sections. There is an art to this, because 
      every ship is different. The decisions about where to cut are made by 
      the yard's owner and the all-important shipboard supervisor. Within 
      the logical demolition sequence (which with variations runs roughly 
      from front to back and from top to bottom) the general idea is to cut 
      off the largest section that can be cleared away from the ship by the 
      shore-based winches. The height and geometry of the superstructure is 
      a crucial consideration, because it affects the way the sections fall. 
      If the work has been done right, when the final cut on a section is 
      made, it falls clear of the hull. It lands on the tidal flat with a 
      dull thump. The ground crew walks out to it, attaches a cable, and 
      winches it higher onto the beach to carve it up. Meanwhile, the 
      shipboard crews may already have dropped another section. At this 
      early stage it can be gratifying work. If the superstructure is 
      flimsy, the crews can make the metal rain.</p>
          <p>But the work slows when 
      they come to the hull, where the steel is heavier and harder to cut. 
      At that point, even for veteran workers, there must be a moment of 
      hesitation at the audacity of the business. Using little more than 
      cooking gas and muscle power they will tear apart this immense 
      monolith, which towers above the crowds on the sand. It will take six 
      months or a year to finish the job; men will be injured, and some may 
      die. Almost all will to some degree be poisoned by smoke and toxic 
      substances -- and more seriously, no doubt, than they would have been 
      on the streets of India's cities. Nonetheless, the poor cannot afford 
      to be timid.</p>
          <p>They go after the hull by 
      cutting off the forward section of the bow, opening the ship's 
      cavernous forward hold to the outside, and making room for an expanded 
      force of shipboard cutting crews. Half of them continue to cut at the 
      forward section, slowly moving aft; the other half burrow directly 
      back through the ship, cutting away the internal bulkheads, until they 
      come to the engine room, near the stern. The ship's engine is not 
      usually saved, because generally it is worn out, and in any case it is 
      often too large to be removed whole. The crews open ventilation holes 
      through the sides of the hull, unbolt the engine, disconnect it from 
      the shafts, and cut it apart crudely on the spot. They drag the pieces 
      forward through the length of the ship with the help of small winches 
      placed aboard for that purpose.</p>
          <p>To understand why it is 
      important to remove the engine early in the process, consider that the 
      ship continues in part to float throughout the scrapping process, and 
      that high tides lift it, allowing the progressive winchings by which, 
      as the hull is consumed, it is drawn onto the beach. From the start 
      the ship's trim is a consideration. If the angle at which the keel is 
      floating does not match the slope of the ocean floor, the ship may 
      hang up offshore. The trick is not to get the bow to ride high, as one 
      might assume, but, rather, to keep the stern of an unladen ship from 
      riding too low. The stern naturally rides low because of the weight of 
      the superstructure, the engine, and the machinery installed there. 
      Once the scrapping is under way, the correct trim can be maintained 
      only by the judicious removal of weight. Cutting away the 
      superstructure and removing the heavy bronze propeller does not fully 
      compensate for the subsequent loss of the bow section, whose weight, 
      because it lies so far forward of the ship's center of gravity, has a 
      disproportionate effect on the trim. That is why the breakers must go 
      in from the opened bow and take out the engine. Afterward the 
      demolition proceeds so predictably, from bow to stern, that it is 
      possible to mark its conclusion precisely when the ship's rudder lies 
      at last on dry ground, submitting to the torches. The workers do not 
      celebrate the achievement, because if they are lucky, the next ship 
      has already arrived.</p>
          <p>Plot 138, the yard that I 
      settled into, was the domain of Paras Ship Breakers Ltd., a company 
      owned by a man named Chiman Bai, who began his career as an errand boy 
      in the ancient Bhavnagar market and rose to become a shopkeeper 
      selling rice and wheat. Bai got into the shipbreaking business in 
      1983, when he responded to an obscure notice in the newspaper about 
      the availability of plots at Alang. I never met him, I think because 
      he felt awkward with foreigners; it was said that he still worked from 
      a back office in the market and that he presided over an extended 
      family of thirty-five, all of whom lived in a single house in 
      Bhavnagar and ate their meals together in the traditional way, sitting 
      on the kitchen floor. His younger brother, Jaysukh Bai, ran the 
      shipbreaking operation day to day. He was a square-jawed, gray-haired 
      man with a Hindu cloth bracelet and a diamond ring. He did business at 
      an office in Bhavnagar every morning, and in the afternoon made his 
      way to Alang, where he sat among his sons and nephews on a porch 
      overlooking the yard. I sat with him sometimes, drinking the Indian 
      cola called Thumbs Up, breathing the acrid smoke from the final 
      cutting of ship parts, some of which was done nearby. Jaysukh Bai did 
      not seem to notice the smoke. One of his nephews figured that I did. 
      He distrusted me, and repeatedly made that clear. Once he said 
      nastily, "The question I want to ask the environmentalists is if you 
      should want to die first of starvation or pollution."</p>
          <p>I said, "They say you 
      don't have to make that choice."</p>
          <p>He said, "That's 
      bullshit."</p>
          <p>In a place like Alang, he 
      was probably right.</p>
          <p>Sometimes I wandered 
      across the road, into the crowded shantytown where the workers lived, 
      a place with shacks built of wood and ship's paneling, some on stilts 
      over a malarial marsh that bordered the beach. There were no latrines 
      at Alang, in part because few of the men would have used them. They 
      preferred simply to relieve themselves in nearby bushes, as they had 
      in the farming hamlets from which they came. But of course Alang was 
      much larger than a hamlet, and as a result the air there was filled 
      with fecal odors, which mixed with the waves of smoke and industrial 
      dust to permeate the settlement with a potent stench. People got used 
      to it, as they did to the mosquitoes, and the flies. Discomfort was an 
      accepted part of living in Alang, as was disease. Thousands of workers 
      who were sick, injured, or unemployed lingered in the shantytown 
      during the day, lying on scavenged linoleum floors by open doorways, 
      or sitting outside in the thin shade of the walls. There were almost 
      no wives or children. As in other migrant camps, drunkenness, 
      prostitution, and violence were never far away.</p>
          <p>Nonetheless, a semblance 
      of normalcy was maintained. For instance, Alang had a good 
      drinking-water system, a network of communal cisterns supplied by 
      truck, which was Captain Pandey's pride. It also had Hindu shrines, 
      informal cricket fields, and enough spare power for its commercial 
      district to run refrigerators and gay little strings of lights. Each 
      evening when the workday was done, the settlement came to life. The 
      workers cooked outside their shacks in small groups intent on the 
      food, and afterward, feeling renewed, they gathered in the light from 
      the cafés and talked. They laughed. They listened to music. Sometimes 
      they held religious processions. Sometimes they danced. And then on 
      Sundays, when by law all the shipbreaking yards were closed, they 
      washed, dressed up, and strolled among friends, looking fresh and 
      clean-cut.</p>
          <p>One evening a small group 
      from Plot 138 invited me to sit with them outside their shack, and one 
      of them went off into the slum and came back with a man who could 
      translate. It was awkward for everyone. The men were formal with me. I 
      asked about their work. They knew it was risky and could make them 
      sick, but they seemed more interested in letting me know they were 
      cutters, and stood high on the scrapyard scale. I asked about their 
      bosses, and they named some of the supervisors who had given them 
      jobs. They said that in other yards some of the supervisors were 
      abusive. They offered no opinions about Jaysukh Bai, maybe because 
      they had seen me with him.</p>
          <p>After a week Pravin 
      Nagarsheth arrived from Bombay to check on his shipyard, a few plots 
      down from Plot 138. A ship lay there half consumed on the beach. 
      Nagarsheth brought his son-in-law with him, a slim city boy in 
      undersized Ray-Bans who slipped carefully around the workers and 
      confided to me, "The first time I came here, I was totally zapped." He 
      meant he was surprised. He seemed a bit precious. But Nagarsheth was 
      not like that, and neither was Jaysukh Bai. They were direct men who 
      walked willingly among their laborers; and though they had grown 
      wealthy on the backs of the poor, they had maintained a connection to 
      them nonetheless. The alternative seemed to be the disengagement I had 
      witnessed in New Delhi and Bombay, where the upper levels of society 
      were floating free of the ground, aided by the airlines and the 
      Internet, as if the poverty in India were a geographic inconvenience. 
      Nagarsheth's own daughter had graduated from the University of Chicago 
      with a degree in computer science, and he was proud of her. But 
      standing beside him on the beach, in the midst of his piles of scrap, 
      I suspected he knew that shipbreakers were unfashionable among the 
      Indian elites. He may even have been able to see himself as they did 
      -- an angry little man with a propensity for mucking around in the 
      world's garbage. In the foreign press I had discerned an undertone of 
      mockery about such things, a vestige of the old colonial amusement at 
      the very idea of native kings. Even the Baltimore Sun had indulged in 
      the fun, quoting an interior decorator from Bombay who ridiculed the 
      flamboyant tastes on exhibit in the shipbreakers' big houses in 
      Bhavnagar. Such public amusement was of course noticed elsewhere in 
      India, especially among the ruling classes, who were so successfully 
      joining the "global" (meaning Westernized) society. Now, in Bombay and 
      New Delhi, a young and soon to be powerful generation was returning 
      from European and American universities speaking the language of 
      environmentalism. And Alang was becoming an embarrassment.</p>
      <h3>The Future of Alang</h3>
          <p>ALANG has become a 
      metaphor in the crucial struggle of our time -- that between the First 
      World and the Third, the rich and the poor. Beneath our perspectives 
      on a shrinking world lurks an opposing reality, hidden in the poverty 
      of places like South Asia, of a world that is becoming larger -- and 
      unmanageably so. Do we share a global ecology? On a certain level it's 
      obvious that we do, and that therefore, at last, a genuine scientific 
      argument can be made for the imposition of Western knowledge. But 
      making this argument is difficult, full of political risk and the 
      opportunity for self-delusion. In practice, the world is as much a 
      human construct as a natural one. The people who inhabit it have such 
      radically different experiences in life that it can be almost 
      surprising that they share the same air. This is inherently hard to 
      accept from a distance. Too often we have a view of what is desirable 
      for some other part of the world which is so detached from daily 
      existence there that it becomes counterproductive, or even inhumane. 
      Alang is a typical case. Resentful Indians kept saying to me, "You had 
      your industrial revolution, and so we should have ours." I kept 
      suggesting in return that history is not so symmetrical. But of course 
      they knew that already, and viewed Alang with more complexity than 
      they could express to me, and were using a simplified argument they 
      felt I might understand. On the ship-scrapping beach at Chittagong, in 
      Bangladesh, I met an angry man who took the simplest approach. He 
      said, "You are sitting on top of the World Trade Center, sniffing 
      fresh air, and talking about it. You don't know anything."</p>
          <p>He was angry about the 
      West's presumptuousness and its strength. He was angry about people 
      like Claire Tielens, at Greenpeace. When I talked to Tielens in 
      Amsterdam, she was unyielding about Greenpeace's demands. She said, 
      "Ships should not be scrapped in Asia unless they are decontaminated 
      and they don't contain toxic materials. New ships should be built in 
      such a way that they can be scrapped safely -- so without hazardous 
      materials if possible. The export of toxin-containing ships from 
      Western countries to developing countries should be stopped. And if 
      possible, ships should be cleaned throughout their lifetime. If they 
      export clean steel, that's fine with us."</p>
          <p>I said, "But ships will 
      always contain toxic wastes. Is it economically possible to ..."</p>
          <p>"'Economically'? Well, of 
      course that's a very flexible term."</p>
          <p>I thought the economics 
      might be less flexible than she believed. One of the twists in this 
      story is that the U.S. government, an entity that Greenpeace has a 
      prerogative to dislike, has become without question the world's most 
      principled shipowner, and as such is leading the way in establishing 
      the real costs of doing things right. I spent an afternoon last winter 
      at an anchorage run by the Maritime Administration on the James River 
      in Virginia, climbing through floating wrecks among the ever-growing 
      number of government derelicts awaiting a proper domestic disposal. On 
      one ship a workman had painted SINK ME! as a way of tempting fate. All 
      these ships were rusting through. The annual costs for routine 
      monitoring, pumping, and patching amounted to an average of about 
      $20,000 per vessel. That may not seem like much, but many of the hulls 
      were in such poor condition that to keep them from sinking, they would 
      soon have to be dry-docked for million-dollar repairs -- only to be 
      towed back to their moorings to continue rusting. The ships could now 
      be bought for a mere $10 each, but even at that price there were no 
      takers. At the Maritime Administration's headquarters in Washington, 
      D.C., people recognized the absurdity of the situation and could laugh 
      about it. All they could do was hope for congressional funding to pay 
      for the scrapping of the ships.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, the Navy was 
      proceeding with its four-ship, $13.3 million pilot project. Dockside 
      at Baltimore Marine Industries the next day I visited a small frigate 
      named the Patterson that was being meticulously dismantled by a crew 
      of fifty-four specialists working under the close supervision of a 
      former Navy diver, who informed me, when I asked about the schedule 
      and cost, that safety and a clean environment were his main concerns. 
      His ship had space-suited workers, positive-pressure filtered 
      ventilation, sealed hazardous-materials bins, color-coded placards, 
      and micron socks hanging from the scuppers to purify the rainwater 
      that drained from its immaculate decks. I realized I was in the 
      presence of a shipbreaking pioneer. He understood the ethical need to 
      spend millions more on a useless ship than its steel was worth. He 
      consulted with chemists, liaison people, and all sorts of engineers. 
      He shared information openly with his competitors, and expected them 
      to do the same. He enforced a wide range of regulations, and fairly. 
      He worked well with unions. He even took time to respect the memory of 
      the Patterson's sailors. His shipbreaking mission was so righteous it 
      was practically Calvinistic.</p>
          <p>That was true of 
      Greenpeace's mission too. But there was a strange reversal. The U.S. 
      Navy for once was concentrating on its own local problem, while 
      Greenpeace was insisting that it had a mandate from "the global 
      society" and "citizens of this planet." Words like those can come 
      across as direct threats of conquest -- all the more so in weak and 
      uncertain places like the impoverished parts of India that are already 
      suffering from the disengagement of the elites.</p>
          <p>I don't think Claire 
      Tielens worried about such sensitivities. She told me that she had 
      chosen her path because she wanted to fight injustice. She was a true 
      idealist. But she did not feel reluctant to say "The recycling of 
      toxic waste is such a hazardous activity that you cannot leave it to a 
      developing country to do that. People say 'Why don't we export our 
      knowledge and technology, and they can improve their conditions, and 
      everything will be fine.' But nothing will be fine, because it's not 
      just a matter of know-how and technology. Because to successfully 
      export our environmental knowledge to India, you would also have to 
      export the whole way society is organized." She was right about that, 
      of course. But whereas others might hesitate over the implications of 
      such ideas, she was not about to question the Greenpeace crusade. Her 
      terms were unconditional: if she had her way, India would have to 
      lose.</p>
          <p>WHAT Greenpeace wants 
      from shipbreaking must seem in the tidy confines of Holland to be 
      perfectly fair -- essentially, to treat shipping as if it were any 
      other orderly industry, and to hold it responsible for its toxic 
      by-products and the safety of its workers. The problem is that 
      shipping is like the larger world in which it operates -- an 
      inherently disorderly affair, existing mostly beyond the reach of 
      nations and their laws, beyond the dikes and coastal horizons, and out 
      across the open seas. It is not exactly a criminal industry, but it is 
      an amoral and stubbornly anarchic one. And it admits as much about 
      itself: at last June's shipbreaking conference in Amsterdam one of the 
      all-important London-based maritime insurers raised the fear that if 
      somehow the reforms go through, even assuming they apply only to the 
      most visible European shippers, there will be a corresponding increase 
      in mysterious sinkings.</p>
          <p>But others in the 
      business told me that the more likely effect of the reforms, as long 
      as money can be made in Third World scrap, would simply be a new and 
      less direct route to Asia: ships would pass through more hands, would 
      maybe live longer plying faraway waters under new names and flags, and 
      would still end up dying on some filthy beach. Such changes are 
      already happening, though it will be a year or more before 
      Greenpeace's campaign results in any new laws in the European Union 
      and at the International Maritime Organization. There is evidence that 
      some European shippers have begun to find new foreign buyers for 
      vessels that they would normally have sold directly to scrappers, and 
      Shell has recently decided to re-inspect and retain certain aging 
      tankers rather than face the wrath of Greenpeace again. Paradoxically, 
      such policies may lead to an increase in hull failures and spills -- 
      currently a big problem on the oceans. The lovely coast of Brittany 
      will suffer for many years because of the loss of the Erika -- a 
      decrepit Maltese-registered tanker, overdue for scrapping, that broke 
      in two off Brest last winter. Greenpeace protested the lax enforcement 
      of European port controls -- to good effect. But on the scale of the 
      world, shipping is terribly difficult to police.</p>
          <p>Few observers seriously 
      believe that as a result of Western pressures, South Asia as a whole 
      will now lose the scrapping business. But this offers little solace to 
      the scrappers at Alang, because there is serious competition within 
      the region, especially from Bangladesh. At Chittagong starvation wages 
      are paid and labor and safety regulations are utterly lacking, so a 
      shipbreaker can send a thousand barefoot men to tear apart a single 
      vessel and scrap even a supertanker in six months. Bangladesh is not 
      so much a nation as a condition of distress, and any attempt to 
      regulate the industry there would obviously be futile. As a result of 
      this commercial advantage, the Bangladeshis can pay top dollar for 
      ships. During my stay at Alang such international competition had 
      forced the bidding level for scrap ships above the price necessary to 
      break even within India, and the scrappers currently acquiring vessels 
      were having to gamble on a significant rise in the Indian metal 
      market. It was a dangerous time.</p>
          <p>Pravin Nagarsheth was not 
      sanguine about Alang's prospects. He worried that the Indian beach had 
      been singled out for special criticism, and that the publicity of the 
      Greenpeace campaign was exacerbating the existing competitive 
      pressures. There was evidence, he said, that some of the biggest 
      shippers had begun quietly to shy away from India entirely, and to 
      direct their ships to more discreet beaches. He worried also about the 
      process within India whereby the European campaign seemed to be 
      changing domestic attitudes toward Alang -- a change that in the end 
      may prove more threatening to the work there than the eventual 
      enactment of foreign laws. Either way, Nagarsheth wanted me to know 
      how little it would take to destroy Alang.</p>
          <p>Jaysukh Bai, the boss of 
      Plot 138, was a relief to me, because he seemed almost unaware that 
      his work might be considered wrong. He was a simple man, who knew the 
      mechanics of the trade. As if I might not have heard, he said, "There 
      are certain Western lobbies who are interested that shipbreaking not 
      continue." But he never once mentioned any concern for safety or the 
      environment. He never once mentioned his workers. He said, "I am 
      worried about the future. What is important is the turnaround time. If 
      there are too many rules to comply with, we will waste time." It was a 
      statement of fact, hard to argue with. I asked him how many ships he 
      had broken. He counted on his fingers, because he remembered every 
      one. Eventually he answered: thirty-eight. He told me they included 
      the biggest ship ever grounded at Alang, a French supertanker of 
      52,000 tons. Those were the good old days. With that ship Captain 
      Pandey must have had great fun.</p>
          <p>The one here now, the old 
      Sun Ray from the Maldives, was only 15,000 tons, but it seemed very 
      big to me. Jaysukh Bai told me he could do the job on it, start to 
      finish, in a mere four months. That was very fast, and he may have 
      been bragging. But only one month into it the superstructure and fuel 
      tanks had been cut up and hauled away, and the lightened hull was 
      being winched forward on the high tides and consumed with voracious 
      efficiency. Even the birds joined in, pecking through the debris along 
      the waterline, as alert as any man on the shore to the shreds of 
      opportunity -- a shard of torn plywood, pieces of wire for nest 
      building, splinters of steel. I went down to the ship when I could, 
      past the ground crews who by now had grown used to my presence. At the 
      torn bow I climbed through the broken bilge into the huge forward 
      cargo hold, now open to the sky. The ship was mine to wander -- up 
      precarious ladders to the main deck high above, through passageways 
      and equipment rooms where the peeling paint and rusted steel gave 
      evidence of the years of wandering and hard use, and ultimately of 
      neglect. Nonetheless, I felt a sort of awe, and was never in a hurry 
      to leave. After climbing back down from the main deck into the hold, I 
      sometimes walked deeper still into the depths of the ship. It was 
      eerie and dim on the inside, an immense man-made cavern filled with 
      hoarse warning cries, the hiss of torches, sparks, smoke, heavy 
      hammering, the sound of falling debris. It had paths made of narrow 
      beams with oil-slick footing, and sudden gaping holes that seemed to 
      emerge out of nowhere. If you fell there, you could certainly die. But 
      after the glare and heat outside, it was also pleasantly cool. The 
      workers did not seem to mind my presence, or even to wonder about it. 
      They appeared sometimes like ghosts, moving fast and in file without 
      speaking. They were very dirty. They were very poor. But they lacked 
      the look of death that I had seen on the men in the Bhavnagar 
      re-rolling mill. They were purposeful. Toward the stern, where 
      sunlight streamed through rough-cut ventilation holes and struck the 
      oil-blackened walls, the towering engine room had the Gothic beauty of 
      a cathedral.</p>
