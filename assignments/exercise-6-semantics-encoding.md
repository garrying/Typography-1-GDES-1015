# Exercise 6—Semantics and Encoding

Designing with typography makes use of the semantic as well as the syntactic dimensions of visual communication—this is especially the case with web typography. The semantic aspect of web typography is concerned with the meaning embedded in the content and how it is indicated in a way that is machine-readable (i.e. web browser) and eventually human-readable (i.e. user). The syntactic aspect of web typography is concerned with the visual form of the information and how elements are arranged—this contributes to the meaningfulness of the content, its readability, and its aesthetic appeal. This exercise will allow you to explore how textual information is semantically encoded in HTML for web browsers. This a first step to structuring information before employing visual styles (CSS).

## Learning Objectives
- Manipulate basic typographic/spatial structures at the level of word and sentence.
- Analyze and explain the contributing factors of readability, legibility and hierarchy as the fundamentals of effective typographic communication.
- Integrate systematic processes and decision-making into both design activity and its documentation.

## Materials/Tools Required
- Laptop
- Sublime Text/VS Code/Atom (or other text editor for code)
- Chrome/Firefox/Safari browser

## Steps
1. Go to [wikipedia.org](https://www.wikipedia.org) and select an article you find interesting and that contains a good variety of information.
2. Copy all the article information including references, special sections, captions, etc, (no need to copy the left navigation bar).
3. Paste text into an empty document in Sublime Text and save the file as “ex6_raw_text.txt”.
4. Create a new document in Sublime Text and save the file as “ex6_semantic.html”.
5. Convert the raw text into a semantically-encoded HTML file:
    - Use the [type1_html_basics_cheat_sheet.html](./content/type1_html_basics_cheat_sheet.html) as reference for HTML tags
    - Use the [type1_html_semantic_outline](./content/type1_html_semantic_outline.jpg) as reference for how to structure the document semantically
    - Create a basic HTML structure (as shown in the cheat sheet).
    - Begin copying from the raw text and inserting into the HTML file in the appropriate sections
    - Use appropriate HTML tags for the text.
    - Occasionally check the original Wikipedia article to see how information is structured. NOTE: You may have to adjust and edit the raw text so that it fits a semantic structure.
    - Open your “ex6_semantic.html” in Chrome to check your work.
6. Continually test your work by:
    - Saving your work in the text editor
    - Refreshing the browser window where you have the html file open
7. Options to advance your skills:
    - Add internal links to sections of the document
    - Add external links to other pages
    - Add images
    - Copy the contents of your file to a project on [glitch.com](https://glitch.com) or your own OCAD U webspace
8. Submit the following files as one archive (zip file) to Canvas by end of class:
    - (optional) Raw text file
    - HTML file
    - Ensure the URL to the Wikipedia page is in the Raw text file or HTML file
