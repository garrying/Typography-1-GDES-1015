# Exercise 8—Iterating, Prototyping, Testing, and Revising

An integral part of design for print or web is iterating, prototyping, testing, and revising your design. This can be printing spreads and mocking up a book or magazine. This can also be viewing your web files on multiple screens. The purpose of these exercises is to see how your design performs and to make adjustments to address any issues of readability, navigation, technical glitches, etc. In this exercise you are asked to publish your an iteration of you Project 3 files to the web via [Glitch.com](https://glitch.com), or OCAD U Webspace to begin testing your work, making adjustments as you see fit, and experimenting with features if desired.

## Learning Objectives
- Manipulate basic typographic/spatial structures at the level of word and sentence.
- Analyze and explain the contributing factors of readability, legibility and hierarchy as the fundamentals of effective typographic communication.
- Integrate systematic processes and decision-making into both design activity and its documentation.

## Materials/Tools Required
- Laptop
- Sublime Text, VS Code, Atom (or other Text Editor for code)
- Chrome/Firefox/Safari browser

## Steps
1. Update your working files for Project 3 in Sublime Text, for example:
    - add Google Fonts for customize titles and body text
    - adjust margins of the whole body
2. Publish your Project 3 files to [Glitch.com](https://glitch.com) or your OCADU webspace using CyberDuck or Filezilla—follow the instructions in the [ACS-Webspace-Overview.pdf](http://webspace.ocad.ca/docs/ACS-Webspace-Overview.pdf) guide.
3. Test your site on your mobile phone and mobile phone of a classmate. Compare how the site is displayed on the different screens (including the Develop Tools preview in Google Chrome, Firefox, or Safari).
4. Continue adjusting your site so that it displays properly on your mobile phone. You will need re-upload your files (on your laptop) to the webspace (and replace the old versions).
5. Experiment with the following adjustments and features by editing the HTML and/or CSS:
    - add image(s)
    - use em and/or vw, vh instead of px units for sizing and spacing
    - add colour to backgrounds and text
    - make links to sections/chapters
    - arrange different elements to fit in one screen
    - try your own improvements
6. Take a screenshot of your progress.
7. Submit the following files as one archive (zip file) to Canvas by end of class:
    - Mobile phone screenshots
    - URL of your website (share with your peers!)
